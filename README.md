 _Defining evil twin attack:_
----------------------------------------
An evil twin attack takes place when an attacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi access point hoping that users will connect to it instead of a legitimate one. When users connect to this access point, all the data they share with the network passes through a server controlled by the attacker. An attacker can create an evil twin with a smartphone or other internet-capable device and some readily available software. Evil twin attacks are more common on public Wi-Fi networks which are unsecured and leave your personal data vulnerable.


 _Part one_
----------------------------------------
###  attack:

### Steps to build an Evil Twin attack:

• Scan WLAN in the environment for Half a minute and view the various networks discovered.

• Select the network on which to attack.

• Scanning for clients in the network for one minute.

• Presenting customers of the network on which the attack is taking place.

• Selecting a victim and performing a Evil-Twin attack.

• After choosing the victim what do you do?

o Disconnect the victim from the existing network / disable the good twin using SCAPY.

o After the victim connects to the fake network, the Evil Twin network is activated and Portal Captive is activated.

o When connecting to the malicious network the victim is asked to enter the password of his network.

o After the victim enters the password, we as attackers parallel the password to the file we created as victimsPassword.txt
